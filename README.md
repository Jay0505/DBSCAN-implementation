# DBSCAN-implementation

DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm. In this problem, I implemented the algorithm in python. You can read more about it in the paper that proposed this algorithmic approach. (http://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf)

For both the dataset files, I employed both the DBSCAN algorithm and K-means (used the sklearn library)
